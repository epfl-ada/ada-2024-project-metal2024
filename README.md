Exploring economic, political, and cultural influences on narratives and genre trends (11 words)

This project examines the interplay between historical contexts and cinematic narratives, tracing how economic, political, and cultural factors shape genre trends and narrative choices in films across decades. By analyzing film release dates, country origins, and plot summaries, we seek to understand whether significant events influence audience preferences, with themes oscillating between addressing real-world issues and offering escapist experiences. The study also investigates the enduring popularity of certain genres, exploring why some narratives engage audiences over time while others decline. Through analysis of the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset and supplementary contextual data, we aim to uncover patterns that reveal cinema’s role in both reflecting and shaping societal dynamics. Our goal is to tell an insightful story about cinema’s function as a cultural mirror and identities, influencing perspectives, and societal priorities. (131 words)

In this analysis, we investigate how pivotal historical events shaped the cinema industry mainly in the United States, examining shifts in film production, character representation, and thematic content. We focus on how events such as the two World Wars, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War impacted the types and tones of movies produced, particularly in genres like war, drama, and science fiction. Additionally, we explore the rise of women's and ethnic minority representation, considering how social movements like U.S. Civil Rights and women's suffrage may have influenced not just the number of roles but also the nature of these roles.
Our dataset combines information from CMU and IMDB, focusing specifically on U.S. films, including details such as genre, plot sentiment, popularity, ethnicity of cast members, and box office success. By tracking these features across significant historical milestones, we aim to reveal patterns—such as the possible surge of patriotic films during the Cold War or shifts in societal themes following the 9/11 attacks.
Moreover, events like the space race and the advent of the internet sparked an expansion in science fiction, reflecting society's imagination of future technology and outer space. The financial crises, like the Great Depression and the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, may also have influenced cinema, possibly reducing production or favoring themes of survival and resilience.
Through sentiment analysis and the popularity index, we will further assess the mood of cinema in relation to these events, observing how public sentiment and socio-political events interacted to shape the film industry.
