Exploring economic, political, and cultural influences on narratives and genre trends (11 words)

This project examines the interplay between historical contexts and cinematic narratives, tracing how economic, political, and cultural factors shape genre trends and narrative choices in films across decades. By analyzing film release dates, country origins, and plot summaries, we seek to understand whether significant events influence audience preferences, with themes oscillating between addressing real-world issues and offering escapist experiences. The study also investigates the enduring popularity of certain genres, exploring why some narratives engage audiences over time while others decline. Through analysis of the CMU Movie Summary Corpus dataset and supplementary contextual data, we aim to uncover patterns that reveal cinema’s role in both reflecting and shaping societal dynamics. Our goal is to tell an insightful story about cinema’s function as a cultural mirror and identities, influencing perspectives, and societal priorities. (131 words)
